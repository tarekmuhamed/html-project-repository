   <blockquote>The emergence of the term <mark>artificial intelligence</mark> dates back to the fifties of the twentieth century, specifically in the 1950s when scientist Alan Turing introduced what is known as the Turin test that assesses intelligence for a computer, and classifies it smart if it is able to simulate the mind.

   <blockquote>The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.

    The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956.[1] Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a mac
